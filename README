This is a Rails application for entering features of Evergreen and other 
library software known as ILS (Integrated Library Systems).

The library software is stored in the apps table.  Nested underneath 'apps' 
are tables for features, versions, and products that can be used with (or
as part of) the ILS.  Products are linked to the vendors that create or 
make the product available.

The development version of this rails code uses a SQLite3 database, test 
and production use Postgresql databases.

User authentication uses the ruby gem CanCan.
